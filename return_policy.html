            <h1>Return & Replacement Policy</h1>

            <p>At BiBi Gura Moshla, it is uncommon for customers to receive damaged products. However, if there are any
                issues or if we fall short of your expectations, we are committed to upholding the trust you have placed
                in
                us. To reinforce this trust, BiBiGuraMoshla.com allows returns for products that are either damaged or
                incorrectly designed. In such cases, we will offer a replacement with a new item.</p>

            <b>If you are dissatisfied with your order, you can return it provided it meets the following
                conditions:</b>

            <ul>
                <li>The return request is made within 03 days from the delivery date.</li>
                <li>The item must be unused and in its original condition with all tags and packaging intact, without
                    any
                    damage or tampering.</li>
                <li>Any promotional items that came with the purchase must also be returned.</li>
                <li>Refunds or replacements are contingent upon an inspection by the BiBi Gura Moshla team.</li>
                <li>Replacements depend on stock availability from the Supplier. If the item is out of stock, a full
                    refund
                    will be issued without question.</li>
                <li>Please be aware that the Cash on Delivery (COD) convenience charge and shipping fees are
                    non-refundable
                    and will not be included in your refund.</li>
            </ul>

                    size
                    specified on the invoice. If the size matches, refunds will not be considered.)</li>

                <li>Incorrectly printed clothing (e.g., mismatched front/back design, wrong design, or incorrect
