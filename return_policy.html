            **Return & Replacement Policy**

            At BiBi Gura Moshla, it is uncommon for customers to receive damaged products. However, if there are any
            issues or if we fall short of your expectations, we are committed to upholding the trust you have placed in
            us. To reinforce this trust, BiBiGuraMoshla.com allows returns for products that are either damaged or
            incorrectly designed. In such cases, we will offer a replacement with a new item.

            If you are dissatisfied with your order, you can return it provided it meets the following conditions:

            - The return request is made within 03 days from the delivery date.
            - The item must be unused and in its original condition with all tags and packaging intact, without any
            damage or tampering.
            - Any promotional items that came with the purchase must also be returned.
            - Refunds or replacements are contingent upon an inspection by the BiBi Gura Moshla team.
            - Replacements depend on stock availability from the Supplier. If the item is out of stock, a full refund
            will be issued without question.
            - Please be aware that the Cash on Delivery (COD) convenience charge and shipping fees are non-refundable
            and will not be included in your refund.
